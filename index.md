{% marginnote 'ratusha' '![Ratusha](ratusha.jpg)' %}Welcome to vitba.org, a site dedicated to the
Belarusian language.  Here you can find my current projects, which at
the current time consists only of the text
[<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals of Modern
Belarusian</span>](fofmb/fofmb.html).  
  
In order to write
[<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals</span>](fofmb/fofmb.html),
I wrote a computer program that formed a concordance of the Belarusian
language based on the books available from
[knihi.com](http://www.knihi.com/), and I intend to post the entire
concordance to this site sometime (although it is quite large).  Another
thing remaining for me to do is to post audio files of Belarusian speech
on this site.  
  
There is much besides this that needs to be done.  If anyone is
willing to contribute, the following need to be done.  

  - Pronunciation section added to
    [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals</span>](fofmb/fofmb.html).
  - Book of exercises to go with
    [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals</span>](fofmb/fofmb.html).
  - Dictionary to be made from concordance (this one would mean a lot,
    and is the kind of project that really won't succeed without outside
    support.)
  - Proofreading of transcriptions.  This of course can't be done until
    I scan the originals and post them as well.
