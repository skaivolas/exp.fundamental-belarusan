{% marginnote 'ratusha' '![Ratusha](ratusha.jpg)' %}Welcome to vitba.org, a site dedicated to the
Belarusian language.  Here you can find my current projects, which at
the current time consists only of the text
[<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals of Modern
Belarusian</span>](fofmb/fofmb.html).  
  
In order to write
[<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals</span>](fofmb/fofmb.html),
I wrote a computer program that formed a concordance of the Belarusian
language based on the books available from
[knihi.com](http://www.knihi.com/), and I intend to post the entire
concordance to this site sometime (although it is quite large).  Another
thing remaining for me to do is to post audio files of Belarusian speech
on this site.
