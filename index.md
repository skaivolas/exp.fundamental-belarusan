![Ratusha](ratusha.jpg)    Welcome to vitba.org, a site dedicated to the
Belarusian language.  Here you can find my current projects, which at
the current time consists only of the text
[<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals of Modern
Belarusian</span>](fofmb/fofmb.html).  
  
    In order to write
[<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals</span>](fofmb/fofmb.html),
I wrote a computer program that formed a concordance of the Belarusian
language based on the books available from
[knihi.com](http://www.knihi.com/), and I intend to post the entire
concordance to this site sometime (although it is quite large).  Another
thing remaining for me to do is to post audio files of Belarusian speech
on this site.  
  
    There is much besides this that needs to be done.  If anyone is
willing to contribute, the following need to be done.  

  - Pronunciation section added to
    [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals</span>](fofmb/fofmb.html).
  - Book of exercises to go with
    [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals</span>](fofmb/fofmb.html).
  - Dictionary to be made from concordance (this one would mean a lot,
    and is the kind of project that really won't succeed without outside
    support.)
  - Proofreading of transcriptions.  This of course can't be done until
    I scan the originals and post them as well.

I've uploaded the rest of the transcriptions to the Culture section, and
added translations for them.  There are some

I'm back to school, um, hurray? and I've finally got internet again. 
I've typed up a bunch of the transcriptions that I was given by Prof.
Rusak and uploaded them to the Culture section.  I'm sure it's full of
mistakes, but they are interesting accounts.

Well, it's been a long time since anyone's sent me an email here. 
Anyways, over the course of the summer, I've got the concordance filled
out and uploaded, but it's still pretty raw.  I've also finished
converting FofMB to HTML format, so now it really is open.  
Anyways, today on the advice of a friend, I took a look at something
called "belazar" but I have to say I'm a little sceptical of how its
going to turn out.  Written for Windows X86, not GPL'd, and expecting a
lot of contribution from the community...   Well, if it were GPL'd I
sure would feel a lot better about it.  It actually has me thinking
about how I would attack the problem...  am i challenging myself?  FofMB
itself still isn't quite wrapped up, though it's close.

Special thanks to Kern Lunde for the many corrections he sent me. I have
updated FofMB with corrections to those typos and errors he pointed
out.
