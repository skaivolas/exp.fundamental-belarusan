    While living in several former republics of the USSR, I learned to
speak Russian, the <span style="font-style: italic;">lingua
franca</span> of CIS countries.  Russian is spoken by the majority of
adults in the CIS, and has served me well wherever I have traveled in
the former Soviet Union.  Russian is the dominant language in Belarus. 
Nevertheless, Belarusian still holds a prominent position in Belarusian
society as a symbol of Belarusian identity and nationalism.  Many
government documents are printed only in Belarusian and most street
signs are in Belarusian.  Every schoolchild is required to learn the
language, and almost all Belarusians can speak it at least to some
extent.  A knowledge of Belarusian is valuable to anyone who spends any
amount of time in Belarus.  
    This book was written with the assumption that the reader is already
moderately familiar with either Russian or Ukrainian.  Little
explanation is given of noun gender and cases, or verb aspect and
tenses.  The reader should consult either a Russian or Ukrainian grammar
for more details on these principles.  I have attempted, in this book,
to thoroughly describe those parts of Belarusian grammar that differ
from Russian or Ukrainian.  
    There is great variation in the Belarusian language from region to
region, and any attempt to make an authoritative description of the
Belarusian language will be plagued by this fact.  I have strived to
make this work as consistent as possible with the standard Belarusian
used in most literature.  To this end, I have set forth the most common
declensions, conjugations, and vocabulary.
