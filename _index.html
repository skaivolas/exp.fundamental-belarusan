Welcome to vitba.org, a site dedicated to the Belarusian
language.&nbsp;
Here you can find my current projects, which at the current time
consists only of the text <a href="fofmb/fofmb.html"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals
of Modern Belarusian</span></a>.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to write <a href="fofmb/fofmb.html"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals</span></a>, I wrote a
computer program that formed a concordance of the Belarusian language
based on the books available from <a href="http://www.knihi.com/">knihi.com</a>,
and I intend to post the entire concordance to this site sometime
(although it is quite large).&nbsp; Another thing remaining for me to
do is to post audio files of Belarusian speech on this site.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is much besides this that needs to be
done.&nbsp; If anyone is willing to contribute, the following need to
be done.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Pronunciation section added to <a href="fofmb/fofmb.html"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals</span></a>.</li>
  <li>Book of exercises to go with <a href="fofmb/fofmb.html"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals</span></a>.</li>
  <li>Dictionary to be made from concordance (this one would mean a
lot, and is the kind of project that really won't succeed without
outside support.)</li>
  <li>Proofreading of transcriptions.&nbsp; This of course can't be
done until I scan the originals and post them as well.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

I've uploaded the rest of the transcriptions to the Culture section,
and added translations for them.&nbsp; There are some <a
 href="culture/transcriptions/dzyonnik_5_brygady/lyric_lyonya.html">pretty</a>
<a href="culture/transcriptions/dzyonnik_5_brygady/text_4.html">interesting</a>
<a
 href="culture/transcriptions/dzyonnik_5_brygady/vyalikaya_vobryna_village.html">ones</a>,
so <a
 href="culture/transcriptions/dzyonnik_5_brygady/fifth_brigade.html">check
it out</a>!<br>

I'm back to school, um, hurray? and I've finally got internet
again.&nbsp; I've typed up a bunch of the transcriptions that I was
given by Prof. Rusak and uploaded them to the Culture section.&nbsp;
I'm sure it's full of mistakes, but they are interesting accounts.<br>

Well, it's been a long time since anyone's sent me an email here.&nbsp;
Anyways, over the course of the summer, I've got the concordance filled
out and uploaded, but it's still pretty raw.&nbsp; I've also finished
converting FofMB to HTML format, so now it really is open.<br>
Anyways, today on the advice of a friend, I took a look at something
called "belazar" but I have to say I'm a little sceptical of how its
going to turn out.&nbsp; Written for Windows X86, not GPL'd, and
expecting a lot of contribution from the community...&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,
if it were GPL'd I sure would feel a lot better about it.&nbsp; It
actually has me thinking about how I would attack the problem...&nbsp;
am i challenging myself?&nbsp; FofMB itself still isn't quite wrapped
up, though it's close.<br>

pointed out.<br>
