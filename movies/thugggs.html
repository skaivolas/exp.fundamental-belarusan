<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My old roommates and
I really liked making home-movies.<br>
<br>

<a href="xtryme.mov"><img style="width: 320px; height: 250px;"

<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">XTRYME SLEDDING</span></big></a>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my favorite, a mockumentary about the
up-and-coming sport of Extreme Sledding.&nbsp; We really like the movie
"Best in Show" and wanted to make a mockuementary.&nbsp; We shot this
movie on in January '04.&nbsp; Ryan and Devin came up with the idea for
extreme sledding the month before after coming back home from
saucering.&nbsp; We borrowed heavily from Rocky IV for some of the
themes.<br>

<a href="fhe_small.mov"><img style="width: 320px; height: 250px;"
 alt="BYU_cop_car" src="cops_byu.jpg"><br>
<big><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">COPS: BYU</span></big>
</a><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another film that we made later.&nbsp; I like it,
but I don't think its as good.&nbsp; The idea came from "Troops," a
film that crosses Cops and Star Wars.&nbsp; The film is a lot more
disjointed because it was made by many more people and so wasn't as
coordinated.<br>

<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Life and Times of David Creer</span></big></a><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is our very first film.&nbsp; It is a very
typical home-movie; nonsensical and unplanned.&nbsp; This little one
isn't worth the trouble.<br>
