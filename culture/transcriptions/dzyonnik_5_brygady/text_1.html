&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You go to him for work, he pays you.&nbsp; Just like
on the collective farm, like the collective farm.&nbsp; We didn't live
badly with the master, whoever didn't have land at all would come here
to serve.&nbsp; Here there were quarters.&nbsp; Complete apartments and
everything, and firewood.&nbsp; There was no need to buy firewood,
we'll go and get firewood, and he'll pay you, and also we'll throw off
some firewood for ourselves.&nbsp; It'll burn, and we'll bring some
again, and for ourselves too, and the master will pay you for this,
that you go and bring firewood, and for yourself too.&nbsp; Whoever
works, he will always live.&nbsp; This is true, that how you work, so
you eat, how you don't work, so also in the collective farm is this -
just as you didn't go, so you didn't get any work.<br>
