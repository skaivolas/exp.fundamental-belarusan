&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I worked for the landlord.&nbsp; Maybe 12-13
years I plowed for the landlord.&nbsp; You still don't lift the plow,
roughly.&nbsp; My brother was a draftsman, pretty much so, for the
landlord, it was like in the collective farm.&nbsp; So I go to work,
they tell me "Take a pair of horses, harness up and go plow, or haul
bushels, or do whatever."&nbsp; Well, just like in the collective farm,
the same thing.&nbsp; And from the village they would come, work, from
Novaye Syalo, and from Paharelki we come here for the landlord.&nbsp;
He assigns you to break flax and so however many days you work on that,
they give so much land.&nbsp; But for this land, for all this one has
to work so many days.<br>
