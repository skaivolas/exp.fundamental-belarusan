</div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yaremichy was founded by Yarmalay.&nbsp; Yarmalay
was the brother-in-law of the father of Kanstantsin Rayetski (the
landowner), from whom Kashyts purchased the estate.&nbsp; Yarmalay
first chose this place for building a water station.&nbsp; Because of
this, his beloved brother-in-law called it Yaremichy.&nbsp; At that
time Yaremichy was one of the best places for building a water station
because the river Nyoman flowed past here.&nbsp; The water station
served for shipping grain, wheat to the Baltics, Kletsk, and other
cities.&nbsp; On the bank stood brick buildings, which were called [...]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the winter, grain was brought here by horses from
distant parts of the region.&nbsp; Grain was brought from Nyasvizh,
Haradzeya, Staubtsy, Slabodka, and other cities.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From a few cottages, a small hamlet grew up, which
was located on the bank of the river.&nbsp; The community began to grow
large.&nbsp; Because of the invasion of the Tatars, Yaremichy was
completely leveled and ruined.&nbsp; After the expulsion of the Tatars,
there began the settlement of this village by various peoples: Tatars,
Russians, Swedes, Jews.&nbsp; At this time the church was built.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Earlier on this place there was a gravesite with a
small chapel.&nbsp; The graves were demolished the church established
in their place.&nbsp; According to data, the establishment of the
church coincides with the 2nd division of Poland.&nbsp; In honor of
this, a bell was poured for the bell-tower with the year 1772 and the
inscription: III division Rechy Paspalitay.&nbsp; The inscription was
done in the Polish language.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The water station from this time lost its former
significance, since the Nyasvizh-Staubtsy-Hrodna railroad was
built.&nbsp; For convenience in speaking, the local inhabitants renamed
Yaromichy to Yaremichy.
