&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier we sang lots of songs.&nbsp; While young we
still would sit, open the windows and sing.&nbsp; It came out
beautifully, as soon as we'd start to sing.&nbsp; But this was long
ago, I havn't really sung for 15 years.&nbsp; I had a great
tragedy.&nbsp; My son died at 27, three years later my husband
died.&nbsp; Oh, hit was so hard for me.&nbsp; I suffered my whole
life.&nbsp; My mother also died, yes she knew many songs.&nbsp; But I
almost forgot, that Kalintsya sang well.&nbsp; And now I live alone in
this house.&nbsp; And not even anyone to talk with.&nbsp; But Kalintsya
was fun, she loved to talk, to sing with her neighbors.&nbsp; Its hard,
but what can one do: one has to live.<br>
