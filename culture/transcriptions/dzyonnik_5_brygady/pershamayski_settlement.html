<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a long time ago.&nbsp; The territory of all
Belarus and part of Ukraine and Lithuania were under the control of the
famous prince Vashtein.&nbsp; Said territory was given to Vashtein in
approximately 1650.&nbsp; Under the control of Vashtein, the people
lived poorly, they payed high taxes.&nbsp; With the money, which was
collected from the people, Vashtein .&nbsp; Rayetski was a relative of
Vashtein and so this land was left to him after the death of Vashtein,
with the exception of Ukraine and Lithuania, which Vashtein lost as a
consequence of wars.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After the war with Napoleon, in which Dunin-Rayetski
was recognized as an exceptional commander and his palace was
destroyed.&nbsp; Kanstantsin in 1837 founded a new estate, which stands
to this day.&nbsp; At this time Kashyts arrived from Austria.&nbsp;
Rayetski had become aquainted with Kashyts, being in the Tsar's court
together in St. Petersburg.&nbsp; After this Kashyts decided to visit
Rayetski, who at this time was sick.&nbsp; Here they became closely
aquainted.&nbsp; Kashyts married Rayetski's daughter, and for this he
received this estate as a gift.&nbsp; From this time the estate was
called Kashytsavy.&nbsp; The Tsar's government gave an order to all the
noblemen, that they should share the land with the servants.&nbsp;
That's how the village Karelichy, Tsentra, and Rap'yova were given up.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kashyts borrowed money from a bank for building a
stable, which he did not pay back on time.&nbsp; Because of this they
wanted to take away his estate.&nbsp; He was helped by Mandalevich and
his father.&nbsp; Mandalevich had a butter factory, and his father was
rich and lived in Vilnius.&nbsp; He lent money to Kashyts, thanks to
this he kept his estate.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1926 Kashyts died.&nbsp; The estate was left to
his son Feliks.&nbsp; The income of the estate totaled 126 k rubles,
and expenses 96 k rubles.&nbsp; Feliks Kashyts deposited 30 k into the
bank yearly.&nbsp; In 1939 the Red Army came.&nbsp; The villagers began
to flee, Feliks fled.&nbsp; And after, having changed his appearance,
he returned to Navagrudak and got a job herding cows.&nbsp; After the
Red Army left, he becomes the administrator of the estate.&nbsp; During
the Patriotic War he was killed by the Germans.&nbsp; The land went to
the M.T.S.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1948 the villagers that had worked for the master
submitted a claim, so that they would be given plots for building
houses.&nbsp; So on May 1st the Pershamayski settlement was
formed.&nbsp; On May 1st the inhabitants of the village entered into
membership of the brigade of the Zhdanav Collective Farm (now Tsaruk
Collective Farm).
