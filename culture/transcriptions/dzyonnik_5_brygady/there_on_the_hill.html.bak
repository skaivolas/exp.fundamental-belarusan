hill...]</span><br>
</div>
<br>
There on the hill is an inn, (2x)<br>
In that inn an innkeeper,<br>
Not an innkeeper, but a widow. (2x)<br>
Let us the barn,<br>
For our horses to stand, (2x)<br>
For our brothers to relax.<br>
At a quiet table, (2x)<br>
A writer writes everything with a pen.<br>
About a rich merchant.<br>
And the rich merchant had a good daughter, (2x)<br>
And the little thing grew up.<br>
She pursued every caprice,<br>
And bought a colt,<br>
She left to marry abroad on Polish Street,<br>
To choose there a fine fellow, (2x)<br>
So that a good face, (2x)<br>
So that I loved him. (2x)<br>
Cheese, butter I fed,<br>
Cheese, butter, curd, (2x)<br>
Yes a wheat pastry.<br>
I will send him a bed, (2x)<br>
Me in three rows of pillows,<br>
A fourth featherbed,<br>
Near the side a girl.<br>
<br>
(Laman A.V., 90 years old, Boutsichy village)
