</div>
<br>
Oh cornflowers, cornflowers,<br>
Many of you I pick in the field.<br>
There near the very river,<br>
Jan gathered them for Lyonya.<br>
Lyonya picked a cornflower,<br>
And bowed her head low.<br>
Dear, see my cornflower<br>
floats and doesn't sink.<br>
Lyonya loved the river,<br>
And she did not fear storms,<br>
Often for entire nights,<br>
She rode in the boat with her dear.<br>
Dear took her in his arms,<br>
And looked in blue eyes,<br>
and without end kissed<br>
the thin pale cheeks.<br>
Once dear asked her<br>
To ride in the boat that night,<br>
Lyonya was willing,<br>
He helped her get into the boat.<br>
Silently they sat together,<br>
The boat floated by itself.<br>
And in the lake danger<br>
Threatened Lyonya all around.<br>
Suddenly Dear pulled out a sharp dagger,<br>
He bent low over her.<br>
Lyonya closed her eyes,<br>
A blue wreath fell from her arms.<br>
In the morning came the fishermen,<br>
They found Lyonya in the water,<br>
An inscription on her chest,<br>
That love had destroyed Lyonya.<br>
