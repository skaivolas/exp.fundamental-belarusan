<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There, where now stands Vyalikaya Vobryna, in 1642
was a small tribe.&nbsp; When property inequality started among the
members of the tribe, an elder of the tribe was chosen - Del
Obrynski.&nbsp; The village was placed near a gravesite, and the house,
in which the elder lived, stood behind where the village now
stands.&nbsp; People settled there, and with each year the village grew
bigger and bigger.&nbsp; The village was named after the elder
Obrynski.&nbsp; It was much bigger in comparison with the surrounding
villages.&nbsp; Later, the village was moved to the current place with
the intention of making a straight line, as a canal had been dug from
Skorych to Yaremichy for connecting with the Nyoman, along which grain
was transported to Yaremichy, and from there to Germany.&nbsp; Later,
the famous prince Vashtein was here, who ruled part of Belarus,
Ukraine, and Lithuania.&nbsp; Later rule went into the hands of colonel
Vyatski, a relative of Vashtein.&nbsp; After a few years, Kashyts
appeared from Austria.&nbsp; He was a good aquaintance of
Raetski.&nbsp; Kashyts distributed great gifts to the villagers.&nbsp;
One time, soldiers of the Tsar's army passed by this region, they were
looking on the map for a village called Dobryna, but in their own
manner called it Vobryna.&nbsp; From this time the village began to be
called "Vyalikaya Vobryna."&nbsp; Soon an order was given about the
villagers dividing up the land.&nbsp; The villagers had the right to
own land, pastures, meadows, but they didn't have rights to the
master's forest and hay.&nbsp; They organized riots over the
injustices, carried out on them by the nobles.&nbsp; The conscienceness
of the villagers awakened.&nbsp; In our region, there was cutting down
of the master's forests.&nbsp; The villagers willfully pastured cattle
in the master's meadows.&nbsp; In 1926 Kashyts died, the estate
transfered into the hands of the son - Feliks.&nbsp; In 1939 Western
Belarus combined with Eastern, in consequence of which Soviet authority
was established.&nbsp; In January of 1949, the villagers of our village
formed a collective farm, creating a single brigade.&nbsp; Vyalikaya
Vobryna belongs to the U. Z. Tsaruk collective farm.
