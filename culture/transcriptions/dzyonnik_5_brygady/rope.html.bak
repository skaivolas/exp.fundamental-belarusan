</div>
<br>
Gray eyes and a smart fellow,<br>
He sat on a bench.<br>
The man wove a rope,<br>
Thus he sang a loud song:<br>
"Weave, weave, and don't unwind,<br>
But you are my rope.<br>
And for whom you will be useful,<br>
My one fate I do not know.<br>
Maybe you will be useful<br>
Later in fall to the merchant.<br>
Or early in spring,<br>
As fellows tie you to the sails.<br>
That man did not happen<br>
to sell that rope.<br>
That young woman did not happen<br>
to kiss scarlet lips.<br>
She became aquainted with an old man,<br>
And was wed to him.<br>
And on this, on this rope,<br>
The fine fellow ended life.<br>
<br>
(Laman, A.V., 90 years old, Boutsichy village)<br>
