&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no chapel, they knocked it down.&nbsp; But
there is still one, a tomb, which is closed, there still is one.&nbsp;
And there was another gentleman with the old master, a brother, it
seems, a colonel in the Polish military.&nbsp; From his mother said, he
was interred so conservatively, that now there are many that are buried
better.&nbsp; I myself saw, after the war I was still a kid here.&nbsp;
And these kids, you know, came, broke open the tablet, which was
closed, threw everything out, opened the coffin.&nbsp; So what did they
find?&nbsp; Coal!&nbsp; He was pickled, black-black, like coal.&nbsp; I
saw it myself.&nbsp; We went, there where we dug potatoes, we're going
- that tomb was open, we'll go in and take a look, what's there.&nbsp;
He's lying, it's true, those cuffs were so wide:&nbsp; He was military,
and shoes on him and everything, but it was all black, and he has a
face, has everything, only black.&nbsp; And this girl lifted his
arm.&nbsp; That's how unafraid she was.&nbsp; She climbed down into the
tomb, knocked off the load, which they had thrown on him, and you know,
she dreamed of him at night.&nbsp; She did not know him, did not
know.&nbsp; You, it seems, have made me faint.<br>
