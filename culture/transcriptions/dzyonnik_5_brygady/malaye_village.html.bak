&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many years ago, where we now live, there lived our
ancestors.&nbsp; They didn't live all together, like we do now, but in
clumps.&nbsp; Enemies began to invade their lands.&nbsp; For
protection, they had to unite in order to resist the enemy.&nbsp; After
coming together, they chose an elder, who was named Del Obrynski.&nbsp;
Then our ancestors began to work the land.&nbsp; They worked the land
with wooden implements.&nbsp; Our ancestors lived in dug-outs.&nbsp;
The more time that passed, the better culture began to develop.&nbsp;
Our ancestors began to build cottages.&nbsp; A cottage would have only
one window and a small one at that, and the stove wouldn't have a
chimney.&nbsp; Over the course of time a village appeared, which they
called "Vyalikaya Vobryna."&nbsp; It was called this, because it
appeared first and took up a large area, and also because much more
land became the style.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They began to build Vyalikaya Vobryna and the
village reached a large size.&nbsp; Elder Del Obrynski had to divide
the village into two parts.&nbsp; The smaller part of the village he
gave over to his son and called it Malaya Vobryna.&nbsp; After a while
Obrynski died, and in his place was Rayetski.&nbsp; He took over Malaya
Vobryna as well.&nbsp; Playing in cards, Rayetski lost his estate to
Dzedzin, who was our master until the revolution.&nbsp; In 1948 in
Malaya Vobryna, the collective farm
"Kraina Savetau‡" was formed.&nbsp; Now the village is included in the
U.Z. Tsaruk Collective Farm.<br>
