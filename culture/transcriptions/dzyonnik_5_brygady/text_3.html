&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This master wouldn't touch anything in the world,
they were a supervisor.&nbsp; The master was why the fly flies.&nbsp;
He was a bachlor, unmarried.&nbsp; We were already living there when
his mother died.&nbsp; My mother then interred, washed, cleaned up, and
dressed her.&nbsp; Then for the last rites the priest came, so he had
to be met with song, a religious one.&nbsp; She died, just the same,
the simple women went, washed her, gathered up everything, dressed and
buried her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She had two sons.&nbsp; There was a second, but that
one rode horses and in Turkey he was killed falling off his
horse.&nbsp; That guy loved to ride around the villages, with other
guys, being young.&nbsp; And he rode the horse somehow there, the horse
stumbled, or something, and he fell and was killed.&nbsp; He wasn't
married.&nbsp; Unmarried, one and the other.<br>
